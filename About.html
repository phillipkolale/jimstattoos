        <p class="u-text u-text-1"> Wash hands thoroughly&nbsp;with soap and water before removing Tatu-Derm.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Remove Tatu-Derm 12-24 hours after tattoo application.</span>&nbsp;<br>If after a minimum of 12 hours the Tatu-Derm is filled with fluid, it is time to remove it and clean the tattoo. If it is not filled with fluid you may leave it on for the full 24 hours. We recommend you remove the Tatu-Derm in the shower. Once removed, wash the tattoo area thoroughly, using soap. We recommend H2Ocean Blue Green foam soap or H2Ocean Nothing soap which contains Lidocaine and may help relieve any discomfort.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">After washing, pat tattoo area dry</span>
          <br>Use a disposable paper towel or let it air dry for 15-20 minutes.&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: 700;">DO NOT USE YOUR BATH TOWEL because even</span>&nbsp;a “clean”&nbsp; bath towel harbors bacteria. If your artist instructed you to re-apply Tatu-Derm, please place the second bandage on the tattoo area within 15-20 minutes after removal of the first bandage. You may leave the second bandage on for up to 48 hours.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Once you have removed the Tatu-Derm for the last time, you will begin to use lotion.</span>&nbsp;<br>After your tattoo is washed and dried, apply a small amount of H2Ocean lotion 3-5 times daily until tattoo is completely healed. Everybody has a unique healing process and it can take between 2-6 weeks to heal a tattoo.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Avoid sun exposure for a minimum of 3 weeks after tattoo application.</span>&nbsp;<br>This also means tanning beds. Sun exposure to healing tattoo pigments can cause color fading and prolong or complicate the healing process. We recommend to always apply SPF 30 to healed tattoos when planning on any sun exposure.<br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Do not soak your tattoo.</span>&nbsp;No swimming for a minimum of 3 weeks. This includes hot tubs, swimming pools, lakes, rivers, etc. Swimming or soaking your tattoo can cause bacterial infections, or cause scabbing and flaking to worsen, which may cause permanent damage to your tattoo.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Itching is a normal part of the tattoo healing process;</span>&nbsp;please do not to scratch your tattoo. If itching occurs, apply H2Ocean or pat tattoo for relief.Please consult a doctor at the first sign of any infection.

          <span style="font-size: 2.25rem;">Frequently asked questions</span>
          <br>1. Do we do cover-ups, retouches, or color enhancements on an existing tattoo?
Yes we do. But it is not always easy or possible to pull off. Too much depends on what the state of the tattoo is.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>2. Can I contact you by email, whatsapp or messenger with questions or design ideas?
We do prefer to speak to customers face to face. However, if you still feel you need to write in a query please do the following:
Please indicate your question with as much detail as possible. i.e. Sample pic, exact size, location and your skin type. Please do not expect us to reply unless you give us all the above information. We are a tattoo studio and also are very busy most of the time so please be concise and do not expect a conversation.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>3. Where are we located?
We are based in Eldoret Petreshah building first floor suite 16 call on 0724498034
Please call during reasonable hours.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>4. How much does a tattoo cost?
All prices are as unique as our tattoos, based on many factors: size, intricacy, research and required drawing time, placement and the time it takes to execute the piece. Due to the variety in choice of designs, it is impossible to quote accurately without a consultation. Some tattoos are done in one sitting whereas others require multiple sessions.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>5. How do I set up an appointment?
We advise you to set up a consultation appointment prior to a final/tattoo appointment. You may come down to the studio with any ideas and references that you may have. This makes it easy for us to assess your tattoo needs and the amount of time it will take to complete the task. You will need to talk to the tattoo artist and leave cash deposit of 50% before getting an exact appointment. It is a good idea to call ahead just to make sure things at the studio aren’t too hectic.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>6. How far in advance is booked?
The waiting time varies due to many factors; including researching and drawing your tattoo design and how many people have booked appointments prior to you. It also depends on what your tattoo design is. A small design does not mean we will do it straight away! We also have a lot of other work going on as well.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>7. What subject matters do we tattoo?
We are open to most ideas, including portraits, fantasy, nature, spiritual, art nouveau, renaissance and contemporary arts, photo – realism, tribal, abstract and oriental to name a few. Our limits are based on what we deem to be perfectly suitable to your personality and skin tone. We prefer not working on abusive, sexual and racist themes.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>8. What is the age limit for tattoos?
You have to be 18 and over. No exceptions. We may require identification or proof of age.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>9. What sort of references do I need to bring with me to my consultation?
The more focused and specific the information you provide, the easier it is for us to turn the tattoo of your dreams into reality. There are many things you can bring along to your consultation as references to your idea, including all types of books and print media, photographs, rough sketches, physical objects [i.e., driftwood, a child’s favorite toy, a seashell etc.] With a bit of imagination, almost anything in the world can be a tattoo reference so search with an open mind.
Other than that, a cash deposit is required to set up an appointment. There are many ATM’s available within reach of the studios. This will allow you to set up an appointment without having to wait or make an additional trip to the studio.
The consultation will not take too long either. It usually goes like this: You come in with references we will look at them and discuss them with you, as well as look at the place you’d like to get the tattoo. This is to make sure that the size and placement are appropriate, along with the tattoo’s composition. We also need to see any blemishes, scars and hair in the area. From there we can figure out how much time the tattoo will take, quote a price and proceed to schedule your appointment.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>10. How do I prepare for/on the day of my actual appointment?
Most importantly, you want to be as healthy possible when you come in. Here are some recommendations to help make things go smoothly:
Eat before you come in or else you may feel dizzy or light headed.
Do not drink alcohol or do drugs at least two days prior to getting tattooed. We do not tolerate any alcohol, drugs or intoxicants in our studio.
Have a good night’s sleep the night before getting tattooed.
Wear loose &amp; comfortable clothing that allows access to the area being tattooed. We have an open door policy and will not close our door unless by prior paid arrangement. We are a busy studio and all sorts of other procedures are going on.
Absolutely don’t bring your kids. We have no way of accommodating them. We may allow one, well behaved friend along with you for the appointment but don’t attempt to bring an entourage…
It is OK to bring a screw capped bottle of water, juice or cold refreshment with you in case you get thirsty during your tattoo.
BE on TIME. In Kenya the concept of being on time is always ignored. We will cancel your appointment and not refund your deposit. That is on you. Postponements can be made with at least 48 hrs. notices.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>11. What methods of sterilization do we use?
we  take yours and our safety very seriously. Therefore, we follow strict precautions to ensure you a safe tattooing experience. All our non-sharp equipment is is sterilized in an autoclave which is the same thing they use in a hospital or a dentist’s surgery. Every needle used is brand new and sterile and then disposed of properly after every single procedure, making your tattooing experience as safe as possible.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>12. Does it hurt?
Each person has a different tolerance level for pain, so the question is very subjective. Most clients agree that it is more of an annoyance than<br>
